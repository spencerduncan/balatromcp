MOD LOADING DIAGNOSTIC FILE
===========================

This file should be created if the BalatroMCP mod is loading properly.

Creation timestamp: 2025-06-21T08:15:00Z
Test purpose: Verify mod directory is being accessed by Steammodded

If you can see this file was created in the mod directory, then the mod loading system is working.
If this file is NOT created, then Steammodded is not accessing our mod directory at all.

This file will be created by the mod_loading_diagnostics.lua script.
